# THINGS TO IMPROVE

1. Moving access to the database from controllers to a repositories layer.
2. Restructuring the project to use DDD.
3. Refactor methods so that they are shorter and do a specific task each.
4. Add more unit and integration tests. Also adding a test reporting tool such as mochawesome.
5. Implement a dockerfile or docker-compose file stages to run the application in a very light container.
6. Add husky or some other tool for pre commit hooks.
7. Implement a jenkinsfile or use github actions for CI/CD.
